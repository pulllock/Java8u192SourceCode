/**
 * A counting semaphore.  Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of
 * permits.  Each {@link #acquire} blocks if necessary until a permit is
 * available, and then takes it.  Each {@link #release} adds a permit,
 * potentially releasing a blocking acquirer.
 * However, no actual permit objects are used; the {@code Semaphore} just
 * keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly.
 *
 * <p>Semaphores are often used to restrict the number of threads than can
 * access some (physical or logical) resource. For example, here is
 * a class that uses a semaphore to control access to a pool of items:
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class Pool {
 *   private static final int MAX_AVAILABLE = 100;
 *   private final Semaphore available = new Semaphore(MAX_AVAILABLE, true);
 *
 *   public Object getItem() throws InterruptedException {
 *     available.acquire();
 *     return getNextAvailableItem();
 *   }
 *
 *   public void putItem(Object x) {
 *     if (markAsUnused(x))
 *       available.release();
 *   }
 *
 *   // Not a particularly efficient data structure; just for demo
 *
 *   protected Object[] items = ... whatever kinds of items being managed
 *   protected boolean[] used = new boolean[MAX_AVAILABLE];
 *
 *   protected synchronized Object getNextAvailableItem() {
 *     for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
 *       if (!used[i]) {
 *          used[i] = true;
 *          return items[i];
 *       }
 *     }
 *     return null; // not reached
 *   }
 *
 *   protected synchronized boolean markAsUnused(Object item) {
 *     for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
 *       if (item == items[i]) {
 *          if (used[i]) {
 *            used[i] = false;
 *            return true;
 *          } else
 *            return false;
 *       }
 *     }
 *     return false;
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Before obtaining an item each thread must acquire a permit from
 * the semaphore, guaranteeing that an item is available for use. When
 * the thread has finished with the item it is returned back to the
 * pool and a permit is returned to the semaphore, allowing another
 * thread to acquire that item.  Note that no synchronization lock is
 * held when {@link #acquire} is called as that would prevent an item
 * from being returned to the pool.  The semaphore encapsulates the
 * synchronization needed to restrict access to the pool, separately
 * from any synchronization needed to maintain the consistency of the
 * pool itself.
 *
 * <p>A semaphore initialized to one, and which is used such that it
 * only has at most one permit available, can serve as a mutual
 * exclusion lock.  This is more commonly known as a <em>binary
 * semaphore</em>, because it only has two states: one permit
 * available, or zero permits available.  When used in this way, the
 * binary semaphore has the property (unlike many {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock}
 * implementations), that the &quot;lock&quot; can be released by a
 * thread other than the owner (as semaphores have no notion of
 * ownership).  This can be useful in some specialized contexts, such
 * as deadlock recovery.
 *
 * <p> The constructor for this class optionally accepts a
 * <em>fairness</em> parameter. When set false, this class makes no
 * guarantees about the order in which threads acquire permits. In
 * particular, <em>barging</em> is permitted, that is, a thread
 * invoking {@link #acquire} can be allocated a permit ahead of a
 * thread that has been waiting - logically the new thread places itself at
 * the head of the queue of waiting threads. When fairness is set true, the
 * semaphore guarantees that threads invoking any of the {@link
 * #acquire() acquire} methods are selected to obtain permits in the order in
 * which their invocation of those methods was processed
 * (first-in-first-out; FIFO). Note that FIFO ordering necessarily
 * applies to specific internal points of execution within these
 * methods.  So, it is possible for one thread to invoke
 * {@code acquire} before another, but reach the ordering point after
 * the other, and similarly upon return from the method.
 * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryAcquire() tryAcquire} methods do not
 * honor the fairness setting, but will take any permits that are
 * available.
 *
 * <p>Generally, semaphores used to control resource access should be
 * initialized as fair, to ensure that no thread is starved out from
 * accessing a resource. When using semaphores for other kinds of
 * synchronization control, the throughput advantages of non-fair
 * ordering often outweigh fairness considerations.
 *
 * <p>This class also provides convenience methods to {@link
 * #acquire(int) acquire} and {@link #release(int) release} multiple
 * permits at a time.  Beware of the increased risk of indefinite
 * postponement when these methods are used without fairness set true.
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
 * a "release" method such as {@code release()}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions following a successful "acquire" method such as {@code acquire()}
 * in another thread.

 * mutex, condition variable, semaphore
 * Semaphore信号量，是比互斥锁功能更高级的一个工具，用于提供不同进程或者线程间同步功能的原语。
 *
 * Semaphore实现和Mutex类似，使用一个整形变量和两个原子操作（p、v操作）来实现。Semaphore的p、v操作
 * 可以由两个线程进行操作，而mutex的加锁和解锁操作必须由同一个线程进行。
 *
 * p操作的实现：
 * 当Semaphore的值小于等于0的时候，自旋等待；当值大于0则将值减1，p操作执行结束。
 *
 * v操作的实现：
 * 直接将信号量值加1即可
 *
 * p、v操作都是原子操作。
 *
 * Semaphore有两种类型：二进制信号量和计数信号量
 *
 * 二进制信号量：
 * 信号量的值只有0和1的叫做二进制信号量，功能和mutex类似。
 *
 * 计数信号量：
 * 技术信号量的值是一个大于等于0的值，用来表示可用的资源个数，允许多个线程使用资源
 *
 * 上面说的信号量使用自旋来等待资源可用，这样会浪费CPU时间，可以使用另外一种方式来实现信号量：
 * 使用一个整形变量、一个同步队列和两个原子操作（p、v操作）来实现。
 *
 * p操作的实现：
 * 先将值减1，判断如果值小于0，则将当前线程加入同步队列，并将当前线程进行阻塞；如果值大于等于0，则p操作结束。
 *
 * v操作实现：
 * 先将值加1，判断如果值小于等于0，说明同步队列中有线程，从同步队列中取出一个线程并唤醒；如果值大于0，v操作直接结束。
 *
 * 使用信号量（二进制信号量）可以实现互斥锁的功能，但是有一点重要的区别是互斥锁mutex可以避免进程优先级反转问题。
 *
 * 使用信号量可以实现条件同步，使用同一个信号量，两个线程里面分别进行p和v操作
 *
 * 使用信号量可以解决生产者消费者问题，需要使用一个信号量当做互斥锁，另外两个信号量当做条件变量
 *
 * 信号量的使用还是比较繁琐，很容易出错，可以使用更好地管程来解决信号量这些问题。
 *
 * Semaphore实现依赖于AQS，可根据管程模型来分析。
